# repro_test.kt

## Structure
```text
repro_test.kt
```

---

### ◼◼◼ FILE: repro_test.kt
```kt
fun main(){println("Hello")}
```


### ◼◼◼ END OF FILES - INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOW
**CRITICAL:** Rules for every file (follow strictly and EXACTLY):
- Output only blocks starting with "### ◼◼◼ FILE: <path>" followed by a fenced code block.
- Code block with language tag must follow immediately. Nothing else.
- No bold, no "(updated / fixed)", no explanations, no extra text.

## Examples

## Correct:

### ◼◼◼ FILE: src/components/Button.tsx
```tsx
import React from 'react';
export const Button = () => <button>Click</button>;
```

### ◼◼◼ FILE: utils/helpers.ts
```ts
export const format = (n: number) => n.toFixed(2);
```

## Wrong:

```
**src/app.ts**          ✗
File: config.json       ✗
Here is the update:     ✗
```

Only output "### ◼◼◼ FILE: <path>" followed by a fenced code block. Nothing else.
